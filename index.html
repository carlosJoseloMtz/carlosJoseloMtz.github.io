    <h2>Tech Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Well, I am basically a what it's called <i>fullstack developer</i> I love all the process.. From the requirement
      gathering, modeling, project architecture, frontend design, and full implementation (backend and frontend)
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past 2 years I have been working with e-Commerce systems using hybris platform (Java based)
    </p>
    <p>
      On my free time I try to keep in touch with incomming technologies and frameworks. Lately
      I have been more interested working with Angular2 and Google Polymer for the frontend development
    </p>
    <p>
      As a freelancer I have usually a chance to choise a technology and framework to work with, for the past
      4 years I have worked with Python and Django to create sites and the last year I have been using NodeJS with Express
      to create restful APIs and consume them on the frontend with Google Polymer
